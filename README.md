# iOS-OTA-Downgrader
### (formerly 32bit-OTA-Downgrader)
### Downgrade/restore and jailbreak iOS devices to signed OTA firmwares
- **Linux and macOS** are supported by this downgrade script/tool
  - Windows users can create a Linux live USB (see Requirements)
- iOS 8.4.1 and 6.1.3 downgrades have the option to **jailbreak** the install
  - For iOS 10.3.3, use [TotallyNotSpyware](https://totally-not.spyware.lol) to jailbreak
- **You do NOT need blobs to use this**, the script will get them for you
- This script can also restore your device to other iOS versions that you have SHSH blobs for (32-bit devices only, listed under Supported devices)
- **Please read the "Other notes" section for frequent questions and troubleshooting**

## Supported devices:

- You can identify your device [here](https://ipsw.me/device-finder)
- **iPhone 5C and iPad mini 3 devices are NOT supported (OTA versions are not signed)**
- iPhone 5C can still be restored to versions that you have SHSH blobs for

## Requirements:
- **A supported device in any iOS version (listed above):**
  - A 32-bit device (**jailbreak needed**)
  - An A7 device (jailbreak not needed)
- An IPSW for the version you want to downgrade to
  - Links: [iOS 10.3.3](https://ipsw.me/10.3.3), [iOS 8.4.1](https://ipsw.me/8.4.1), [iOS 6.1.3](https://ipsw.me/6.1.3)
  - The script can also download it for you
- A **64-bit Linux install/live USB** or a supported **macOS** version
  - See supported OS versions and Linux distros below
  - A Linux live USB can be easily created with tools like [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)
- Users with 32-bit devices must install [OpenSSH](https://cydia.saurik.com/package/openssh/)
  - Users in iOS 10 (A6/A6X) must also install Dropbear ([Cydia repo](https://lukezgd.github.io/repo/))
  
<details>
  <summary>For Pangu 32-bit users:</summary>
  <ul><li>For 32-bit users using Pangu, install the latest untether for your iOS version <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/iOS-OTA-Downgrader-Keys/releases/tag/untether">here</a></li></ul>
</details>

## How to use:
1. [Download iOS-OTA-Downgrader here](https://github.com/LukeZGD/iOS-OTA-Downgrader/archive/master.zip) and extract the zip archive
2. Plug in your iOS device
3. Open a Terminal window
4. `cd` to where the zip archive is extracted, and run `./restore.sh`
    - You can also drag `restore.sh` to the Terminal window and press ENTER
5. Select option to be used
6. Follow instructions

## Supported OS versions/distros:
- Ubuntu [20.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/) and [20.10](https://releases.ubuntu.com/groovy/); and Ubuntu-based distros like [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
- Ubuntu [16.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/) and [18.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/bionic/)
    - Use 20.04 and newer as older versions are untested
- [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and Arch-based distros like [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/)
- [Fedora 32 to 33](https://getfedora.org/)
- openSUSE [Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed), [Leap 15.2](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap)
- macOS 10.13 to 11

## Other notes:
- If something in the process does not work for you, try switching USB ports and/or cables (also try using a USB 2.0 port)
- This script will verify the IPSW SHA1 before restoring
- For users having issues related to missing libraries or tools, re-install dependencies with `./restore.sh Install`
  - Alternatively, delete the `libimobiledevice` or `libirecovery` folder in `resources` then run the script again
- For A7 devices:
  - Do not use USB-C to lightning cables as this can prevent a successful restore
  - checkm8 ipwndfu is unfortunately pretty unreliable, you may have to try multiple times (for Linux users, also try in a live USB)
  - If the script can't find your device in pwnREC mode or gets stuck, you may have to start over
  - Other than the above, unfortunately there's not much else I can do to help regarding entering pwnDFU mode.
- For 32-bit devices:
  - To devices with baseband, this script will restore your device with the latest baseband (except when jailbreak is enabled, and on iPhone5,1 as there are reported issues)
  - This script can also be used to just enter kDFU mode for all supported devices
  - As alternatives to kloader/kDFU, checkm8 A5 or ipwndfu can also be used in DFU advanced menu
    - To enter DFU advanced menu, put your iOS device in DFU mode before running the script
  - This script can work on virtual machines, but I won't provide support for them
- For jailbreak option:
  - If you have problems with Cydia, remove the ultrasn0w repo and close Cydia using the app switcher, then try opening Cydia again
  - If you can't find Cydia in your home screen, try accessing Cydia through Safari with `cydia://` and install "Jailbreak App Icons Fix" package ([Cydia repo](https://lukezgd.github.io/repo/))
- For jailbreak option (on iOS 8.4.1 downgrades only):
  - Stashing is already enabled and `nosuid` is removed from `fstab`, so no need to install "Stashing for #etasonJB" package
  - To fix LaunchDaemons not loading on startup, install "Infigo" package ([Cydia repo](https://lukezgd.github.io/repo/))
  - Warning: If your device bootloops with EtasonJB, it may not work with the jailbreak option as well! (I think this applies to some but not all [8942](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/S5L8942)/[8945](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/S5L8945) users) If this happens, bootloop protection will trigger and you won't be able to open Cydia
